## 📝 POST-PROCESSING ISTRUZIONI

Dopo aver generato le texture con AI:

1. **Resize**: Ridimensiona a esattamente 16×16 pixel
2. **Pixelate**: Applica effetto pixelate se troppo smooth
3. **Color Correction**: Adatta ai colori specificati nella palette
4. **Cleanup**: Rimuovi dettagli troppo piccoli per 16x16
5. **Test**: Verifica l'aspetto in-game
6. **Optimize**: Salva come PNG ottimizzato

## 🎯 TIPS PER MIGLIORI RISULTATI

### DO:
- ✅ Specifica sempre "16x16 pixel art"
- ✅ Menziona "Minecraft style" o "Luanti style"  
- ✅ Includi colori esadecimali specifici
- ✅ Specifica "no anti-aliasing"
- ✅ Descrivi funzione del blocco

### DON'T:
- ❌ Non chiedere texture troppo complesse
- ❌ Evita "realistic lighting effects"
- ❌ Non usare "smooth" o "gradient"
- ❌ Evita descrizioni troppo vaghe
- ❌ Non dimenticare di specificare la vista (top/side/front)
